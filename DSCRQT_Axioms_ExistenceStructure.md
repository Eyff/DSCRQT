**Document: DSCRQT – Dual State Complex Realisation Qunatum Theory or Dynamic Structured Configuration and Realization Quantum Theory**

---

### Part 1: Axiom Overview Table

| No. | Axiom Title | Definition |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| 0   | State vs. Configuration | A state is a quantitatively or observably distinguishable property of an element. A configuration is the structured arrangement of system elements. |
| 1   | Continuity of State Change | States change continuously unless an external discontinuity acts. |
| 2   | Discrete Configuration Transitions | Configurations change discretely along defined transition paths. |
| 3   | System Elements and Model Termination | System elements are either atomic or recursive. Model depth is finite. |
| 4   | Existence of States and Configurations | States always exist. Configurations either exist or do not exist. |
| 5   | Realization of Configurations | Configurations are either realized and effective, or not realized. |
| 6   | Actuality and Potentiality | Realized configurations exist in the mode of actuality; non-realized (but structured) configurations exist in the mode of potentiality. |

### Part 2: Predicate Logic Formulation of Each Axiom

**Axiom 0:**
- \( \forall x (State(x) \rightarrow Property(x) \land \neg Structure(x)) \land \forall y (Configuration(y) \rightarrow Structure(y) \land Arrangement(Subset(y))) \)

**Axiom 1:**
- \( \forall z (State(z) \land \neg Interaction(z) \rightarrow continuous(z)) \)

**Axiom 2:**
- \( \forall c_1, c_2 (Configuration(c_1) \land Configuration(c_2) \land Transition(c_1, c_2) \rightarrow discrete(Transition(c_1, c_2))) \)

**Axiom 3:**
- \( \forall e (Element(e) \rightarrow Object(e) \lor System(e)) \land \exists d (Depth(System) = d \land finite(d)) \)

**Axiom 4:**
- \( \forall s (State(s) \rightarrow Exists(s)) \land \forall c (Configuration(c) \rightarrow Exists(c) \lor \neg Exists(c)) \)

**Axiom 5:**
- \( \forall c (Configuration(c) \rightarrow (Realized(c) \leftrightarrow (Exists(c) \land Interacts(c)))) \)

**Axiom 6:**
- \( \forall c (Configuration(c) \land Realized(c) \rightarrow Mode(c, Actuality)) \land (\neg Realized(c) \land Structurable(c) \rightarrow Mode(c, Potentiality)) \)

### Part 3: Paradox Test Cases

| Paradox | Everyday Interpretation | kQP (classical) | DSCRQT (AQP) |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Schrödinger's Cat | "Undecided: dead or alive?" | Superposition until measurement | State structure exists, but configuration is not realized (Potentiality) until transition through interaction |
| Tree falls in forest with no witness | "Was it heard?" | No clear assertion | Movement state exists; configuration is realized if interaction occurred (e.g., ground vibration) |
| State without observer | "No reality without observation?" | No wavefunction without collapse | States always exist; observation is not metaphysical but a configuration transition |

---

### Endnote

The DSCRQT model allows a differentiated ontological treatment of quantum-like processes without mystifying the observer and without maintaining classical paradox theater.

It relies on complex state representation, structural configurations, relational transitions, and the Aristotelian distinction between act and potency (Actuality vs. Potentiality).
